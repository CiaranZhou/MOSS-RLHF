## ðŸŒ  Introduction

Due to the challenges of reward design, environment interaction, and agent training, coupled with huge trial and error cost of large language models, there is a significant barrier for AI researchers to motivate the development of technical alignment and safe landing of LLMs. The stable training of RLHF has still been a puzzle.
In this technical report, we intend to help researchers to train their models stably with human feedback.

Contributions are summarized as follows: 
1) We release competitive Chinese and English reward models, respectively, which have good cross-model generalization ability, alleviating the cost of relabeling human preference data; 
2) We conduct in-depth analysis on the inner workings of PPO algorithm and propose the PPO-max algorithm to ensure stable model training;
3) We release the complete PPO-max codes to ensure that the LLMs in the current SFT stage can be better aligned with humans.
